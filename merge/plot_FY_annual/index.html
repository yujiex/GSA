  <h2>Introduction: Executive Orders and GSA's Energy Goals</h2>

<p>Launched in December 2007, "Energy Independence and Security Act
(EISA)" stated energy reduction goals for federal agencies.[<a href="https://www.epa.gov/laws-regulations/summary-energy-independence-and-security-act">source</a>] <br>
<p>In
the <a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2007-01-26/pdf/07-374.pdf">Executive
Order 13423</a>, several energy reduction goals were described as:
  <ul>
    <li>"reduction of energy intensity by (i) 3 percent annually
through the end of fiscal year 2015, or (ii) 30 percent by the end of
fiscal year 2015, relative to the baseline of the agency’s energy use
in fiscal year 2003"</li>
    <li>"beginning in FY 2008, reduce water consumption intensity,
relative to the baseline of the agency’s water consumption in fiscal
year 2007, through life-cycle cost-effective measures by 2 percent
annually through the end of fiscal year 2015 or 16 percent by the end
of fiscal year 2015"</li>
  </ul>
  
<p>In the <a href="http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?hl=false&edition=2012&req=granuleid%3AUSC-prelim-title42-section8253&f=treesort&fq=true&num=0">42 U.S.C. § 8253(a)</a> the rule stated that:<br>

<p>Each agency shall apply energy conservation measures to, and shall
improve the design for the construction of, the Federal buildings of
the agency (including each industrial or laboratory facility) so that
the energy consumption per gross square foot of the Federal buildings
of the agency in fiscal years 2006 through 2015 is reduced, as
compared with the energy consumption per gross square foot of the
Federal buildings of the agency in fiscal year 2003, by the percentage
specified in the following table<br>

  <h2>Stated goals and objectives</h2>
<p>This data driven study will support the documentation and
categorization of the key areas of operational and capital investments
that generated the US General Services Administration energy
intensity. The in-depth analysis could provide critical insights for
strategic recommendations for ongoing investments in capital and
operational energy upgrades in GSA's owned portfolio. The tasks include:
  <ol>
   <h3><li>Qualification and Quantification of historical energy
savings in relation to energy upgrade investments in 3 Tiers of
Analysis
</h3>
   <h4>Database development</h4>
<p>Carnegie Mellon uses Sqlite to hold energy data, static
information, weather data, as well as available energy upgrade ECM
records. The data sets are unified around building IDs
("Building_Number"). This consolidated data set will be used in all
three levels of analysis.

  <h4>Three tiers analysis</h4>
<p>The three tiers of analysis correspond to the depth of data available from the GSA.
<ul>
  <li><h5><a href="level1.html">Level 1 analysis</h5></a>
<p>Level 1 analysis addresses the full portfolio of GSA buildings for
which there is monthly EUAS data from 2003 to 2015, between 1000 and
1500 buildings. Level 1 analysis include:
  <ul>
    <li>GSA portfolio overview and data quality check
    <li>Total energy usage trend
    <li>EUI distribution trend (A + I, covered facility, capital vs
    operational group)
      </ul>
  <li><h5><a href="level2.html">Level 2 analysis</h5></a>
<p>Level 2 analysis addresses a subset of this portfolio, between 200
and 400 buildings for which there is additionally ECM investment
records and robust energy data. Level 2 analysis include:
  <ul>
    <li>EUI comparison FY2003 vs FY2015 by energy investment type
    <li>Weather normalized saving by ECM actions
      </ul>
  <li><h5><a href="interval/level3.html">Level 3 analysis</h5></a>
<p>Level 3 analysis addresses a final set of buildings, between 50 and
81 buildings, for which there is 15min interval data (and potentially
BAS data from SkyFoundry’s SkySpark). Level 3 analysis include
  <ul>
    <li>Data quality check
    <li>Compared Lean Energy Analysis of week day vs weekend and night
    energy consumption pattern
      </ul>
    </ul>
  <h3><li>Strategic recommendations for ongoing operational and
capital investments</h3>
  
<p>CMU's Center for Building Performance and Diagnostics will use
these tiered data sources to generate data driven recommendations for
future operational and capital investments to ensure ongoing success
in meeting commitments under the Energy Independence and Security Act.
